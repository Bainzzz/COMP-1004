This file here is to explain my project 

My project is a hypertext fiction game that allows the player to navigate the story I have created while having them make their own decisions. 
The project has the player navigate through a variety of encounters where their chocies will make an impact on whether they proceed or not.
There are plenty of hints scattered throughout the game so players that pay close attention will be able to have an easier time.
There's multiple endings to encourage replayability as well as branching paths to make those replays feels fresh
I have scattered items that can be missed if the player doesn't explore enough which can have a major impact on the endings of the game or may change how some encounters go.

I also intended on having some minigames that would show up such as 'lights out' to keep things a bit more interactive and avoid repetition however due to time constraints this was unachievable.
I have developed an extremely simple rock paper scissors game (Orc, Elf, Dwarf rspectively) with very simple interface however I was unable to implement it into my core gameplay loop without breaking it.
I have attached that Rock Paper Scissors game to this repository so it can still be observed.
